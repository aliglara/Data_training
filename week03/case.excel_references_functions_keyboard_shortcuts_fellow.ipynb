    "In this case, you have successfully created a workbook to calculate the list price of all the titles that your small printing press will be releasing next month, as well as some high-level statistics about your business. You have made use of multiple Excel tools like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Variable references - These are the default in Excel. They update the cell references depending on the location of the paste destination\n",
    "* Fixed references - These don't update when you copy and paste a formula. You can make a reference fixed by adding `$` both to the beginning of the column name and the beginning of the row name. You can also fix only the column or only the row. If you want the column to be fixed, you add the `$` to the column name only  (before the letter, e.g. `$A2`); if you want the row to be fixed, you add the `$` to the row name only (before the number, e.g. `A$2`).\n",
    "* Built-in functions - To sum a range of cells, you can use the `SUM()` function and pass the cell range as the input. To calculate averages you use `AVERAGE()`"
